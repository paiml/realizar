# Why From Scratch

> **Status**: Documentation
>
> This chapter will be written when the corresponding feature is implemented and test-backed.

[Content to be added]

This chapter will cover:
- Overview and key concepts
- Implementation details using EXTREME TDD
- Code examples (all test-backed, zero hallucination)
- Best practices and patterns
- Performance considerations
- Real-world examples from the codebase

## Placeholder Notice

This section is currently under development following Realizar's **gating approach**:

1. **Feature must be implemented** - Code exists in `src/`
2. **Tests must pass** - Comprehensive test coverage (unit, property, mutation)
3. **Examples must run** - All code examples are validated by tests
4. **Zero hallucination** - Only document what actually exists

Please check back later or refer to:
- Source code in `src/` directory
- Test files in `tests/` directory
- Working examples in `examples/` directory
- Inline rustdoc documentation

**Contributing**: See [Contributing to This Book](../appendix/contributing.md) for guidelines on adding content.
