**Status:** In Progress
**Executor:** Gemini (Senior QA Engineer Persona)
**Methodology:** Toyota Production System (TPS) + NASA/JPL Mission Assurance

## Summary
Execution of the "100-Point QA Checklist for LLaMA.cpp-Style Inference" (v1.0.0).

## Section 1: Memory Safety

| ID | Hypothesis | Severity | Status | Findings |
|----|------------|----------|--------|----------|
| H₀-001 | No Use-After-Free in KV Cache | S1 | **FAIL** | **CRITICAL:** ASan detected `heap-use-after-free` in `realizar::gpu::tests::test_gpu_compute_auto_creation` -> `GpuCompute::new`. Trace indicates issue in `wgpu` / `libvulkan` interaction during instance creation. <br> **Error:** `AddressSanitizer: heap-use-after-free on address ...` |
| H₀-002 | No Buffer Overflows in Tensor Operations | S1 | PASS | Property-based tests `tests/property_tensor.rs` passed under ASan. |
| H₀-003 | Memory Leak Freedom in Long-Running Inference | S2 | Pending | |
| H₀-004 | Alignment Requirements Satisfied for SIMD | S2 | Pending | |
| H₀-005 | mlock() Respects Resource Limits | S3 | Pending | |
| H₀-006 | Double-Free Prevention | S1 | Pending | |
| H₀-007 | Stack Overflow Prevention in Recursive Operations | S1 | Pending | |
| H₀-008 | Heap Fragmentation Bounded | S3 | Pending | |
| H₀-009 | Zero-Copy Semantics Preserved | S4 | Pending | |
| H₀-010 | OOM Handling Graceful | S2 | Pending | |
| H₀-011 | Shared Memory Thread Safety | S1 | Pending | |
| H₀-012 | GPU Memory Leak Freedom | S2 | Pending | |
| H₀-013 | Memory Pool Exhaustion Handling | S2 | Pending | |
| H₀-014 | Uninitialized Memory Never Read | S1 | Pending | |
| H₀-015 | Virtual Memory Mapping Correctness | S2 | Pending | |
